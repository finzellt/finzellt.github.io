The Computational Education Research Lab (CERL) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu) is an interdisciplinary collaboration that studies how students learn to do computational work and their attitudes about doing that work. In particular, we explore how students learn to integrate computation into their education outside of traditional computer science courses.

Our research group includes faculty, postdocs, and students from the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu) and the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://pa.msu.edu).
